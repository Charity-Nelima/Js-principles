// Synchronous Programming:
// In synchronous programming, each operation is executed one after the other in a sequence. 
// When an operation is being executed, 
// the program "waits" for that operation to complete before moving on to the next one. 
// example
console.log('Start');
console.log('Middle');
console.log('End');
